               Changes in R Package TSSS

             *****************************


 TSSS_1.3.0
==============
* Added an aurgument 'lag' to period().

* Changed value 'arcoef' to output for each order of AR model in arfit().

* Changed value of 'noisew' of examples in ngsmth().

* Denoted or modified theã€€allowed values of arguments 'trend.order',
 'seasonal.order', 'ar.order' and 'period' in season().

* Added 'Note' about the setting of the frequency, i.e., the data with tsp
 attribute gives priority its frequency over 'period' in season().

* Changed the default value for 'lag' from 10 to sqrt(n), where n is the length
 of input time series.

* Changed the plot style of evolutionary power spectra in plot.tvspc().

* Added functions pfilter() (Particle Filtering and Smoothing) and pfilterNL()
 (Particle Filtering and Nonlinear Smoothing).

* Changed function name 'armaimp' to 'armachar'.

* Fixed a bug in armafitf.f / subroutine istat3.

* Added function armafit2() (Scalar ARMA Model Fitting: Estimate all ARMA
 models within the user-specified maximum order by maximum likelihood method).

* Added datasets Haibara and Nikkei225.

* Changed default values for 'wminmax' in case of noisew = 2 (Pearson) and
 'vminmax' in case of noisev = 2 (Pearson) in ngsim().

* Added tsp attribute to all datasets.

* Added an example using Haibara dataset in crscor().

* Added a dataset Rainfall.


 TSSS_1.2.4
==============
* Used the gammafn function provided by R instead of the DGAMMA function in
 Fortran, because an error was found in TSSS-00install.out on
 r-patched-solaris-x86.


 TSSS_1.2.3
==============
* Replaced cat() with message()/warning().


 TSSS_1.2.2
==============
* Fixed problems in Fortran code (comsub.f / SUBROUTINE ARYULE) according to the
 warning messages from gfortran-8 with options -fpic -g -O2 -Wall -mtune=native.


 TSSS_1.2.1
==============
* Chenged the implementation of random number generator to Mersenne-Twister.


 TSSS_1.2.0
==============

* Fixed bug in arfit(), ngsmth() and trend().

* Fixed problems in Fortran code according to the warning messages from gfortran
 with options -Wall -pedantic.

* Merged gdensty(), cdensty(), pdensty(), exdensty(), chi2densty(), dexdensty()
 and udensty() into pdfunc().

* Changed names of function lsar1() and lsar2() to lsar() and lsar.chgpt(),
 respectively..

* Turned output values of each function into an object of S3 class.
 Defined print and plot methods for these classes.

* Added src/init.c.


 TSSS_1.1.0
============

* Changed dataset "Sunspot" into a part of "sunspot.year" in R's core datasets
 package.

* Corrected the tile of the dataset 'HAKUSAN'.


 TSSS_1.0.1
============
* Corrected errors in inst/doc/index.html according to the error message of the
 W3C Markup Validator service.
